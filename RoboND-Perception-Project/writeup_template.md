1. Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.

The RANSAC algorithm assumes that all of the data in a dataset is composed of both inliers and outliers, where inliers can be defined by a particular model with a specific set of parameters, while outliers do not fit that model and hence can be discarded. Like in the example below, we can extract the outliners that are not good fits for the model. 

In this project,  the RANSAC alogorthem is used to seperate the objects from the table, so we will use the RANSAC plane fitting method, The RANSAC algorithm mainly involves performing two iteratively repeated steps on a given data set: Hypothesis and Verification. First, a hypothetical shape of the desired model is generated by randomly selecting a minimal subset of n-points and estimating the corresponding shape-model parameters.

In our case, 3 non-collinear points are needed to determine a plane as described below.Once a model is established, the remaining points in the point cloud are tested against the resulting candidate shape to determine how many of the points are well approximated by the model.

After a certain number of iterations, the shape that possesses the largest percentage of inliers is extracted and the algorithm continues to process the remaining data.

In this project, we use pcl(python cloud library) to implement RANSAC, as is shown in the code below, the cloud is seperated into 
cloud_table and cloud_object.


the code is shown below:

```python 
    # Create the segmentation object
    seg = cloud_passthrough.make_segmenter()

    # Set the model you wish to fit 
    seg.set_model_type(pcl.SACMODEL_PLANE)
    seg.set_method_type(pcl.SAC_RANSAC)

    # Max distance for a point to be considered fitting the model
    # Experiment with different values for max_distance 
    # for segmenting the table
    max_distance = 0.01
    seg.set_distance_threshold(max_distance)

    # Call the segment function to obtain set of inlier indices and model coefficients
    inliers, coefficients = seg.segment()

    # TODO: Extract inliers and outliers
    # Extract inliers

    cloud_table = cloud_passthrough.extract(inliers, negative=False)

    # Extract outliers
    cloud_objects = cloud_passthrough.extract(inliers, negative=True)
```

#### 2. Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.  

Sine we have extract the point of interest of the cloud_objects, now we use the PCL's Euclidean Clustering algorithm to segment the remaining points into individual objects.

In order to perform Euclidean Clustering, you must first construct a k-d tree from the cloud_objects point cloud.

The k-d tree data structure is used in the Euclidian Clustering algorithm to decrease the computational burden of searching for neighboring points. While other efficient algorithms/data structures for nearest neighbor search exist, PCL's Euclidian Clustering algorithm only supports k-d trees.

To construct a k-d tree, you first need to convert your XYZRGB point cloud to XYZ, because PCL's Euclidean Clustering algorithm requires a point cloud with only spatial information. To create this colorless cloud,and  to conver PLC XYZRGB to XYZ point cloud ,then we construct the kd tree.

cluster_indices now contains a list of indices for each cluster.

```python
    # Extract outliers
    cloud_objects = cloud_passthrough.extract(inliers, negative=True)

    ##TODO: Euclidean Clustering 
    white_cloud = XYZRGB_to_XYZ(cloud_objects)
    tree = white_cloud.make_kdtree()

    # Create a cluster extraction object
    ec = white_cloud.make_EuclideanClusterExtraction()
    # Set tolerances for distance threshold 
    # as well as minimum and maximum cluster size (in points)
    # NOTE: These are poor choices of clustering parameters
    # Your task is to experiment and find values that work for segmenting objects.
    ec.set_ClusterTolerance(0.015)
    ec.set_MinClusterSize(20)
    ec.set_MaxClusterSize(3000)
    # Search the k-d tree for clusters
    ec.set_SearchMethod(tree)
    # Extract indices for each of the discovered clusters
    cluster_indices = ec.Extract()
```

the result rivz picture is shown below:

#### 2. Complete Exercise 3 Steps.  Features extracted and SVM trained, and Object recognition implemented.

feature is extracted by flowing method:
```python
def compute_color_histograms(cloud, using_hsv=True):

    # Compute histograms for the clusters
    point_colors_list = []

    # Step through each point in the point cloud
    for point in pc2.read_points(cloud, skip_nans=True):
        rgb_list = float_to_rgb(point[3])
        if using_hsv:
            point_colors_list.append(rgb_to_hsv(rgb_list) * 255)
        else:
            point_colors_list.append(rgb_list)

    # Populate lists with color values
    channel_1_vals = []
    channel_2_vals = []
    channel_3_vals = []

    for color in point_colors_list:
        channel_1_vals.append(color[0])
        channel_2_vals.append(color[1])
        channel_3_vals.append(color[2])
    
    # TODO: Compute histograms
    c1_hist, _ = np.histogram(channel_1_vals, bins = 128,range=(0, 256))
    c2_hist, _ = np.histogram(channel_2_vals, bins = 128,range=(0, 256))
    c3_hist, _ = np.histogram(channel_3_vals, bins = 128,range=(0, 256))

    # TODO: Concatenate and normalize the histograms
    hist_features = np.concatenate((c1_hist, c2_hist, c3_hist)).astype(np.float64)
    # Generate random features for demo mode.  
    # Replace normed_features with your feature vector
    normed_features = hist_features / np.sum(hist_features).astype(np.float64)
    return normed_features 


def compute_normal_histograms(normal_cloud):
    norm_x_vals = []
    norm_y_vals = []
    norm_z_vals = []

    for norm_component in pc2.read_points(normal_cloud,
                                          field_names = ('normal_x', 'normal_y', 'normal_z'),
                                          skip_nans=True):
        norm_x_vals.append(norm_component[0])
        norm_y_vals.append(norm_component[1])
        norm_z_vals.append(norm_component[2])

    # TODO: Compute histograms of normal values (just like with color)
    hist_x, _ = np.histogram(norm_x_vals, bins = 64,range=(-1,1))
    hist_y, _ = np.histogram(norm_y_vals, bins = 64,range=(-1,1))
    hist_z, _ = np.histogram(norm_z_vals, bins = 64,range=(-1,1))
    # TODO: Concatenate and normalize the histograms
    hist_features = np.concatenate((hist_x, hist_y, hist_z)).astype(np.float64)

    # Generate random features for demo mode.  
    # Replace normed_features with your feature vector
    normed_features = hist_features / np.sum(hist_features).astype(np.float64)

    return normed_features
```

Spend some time at the end to discuss your code, what techniques you used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how you might improve it if you were going to pursue this project further.  

### Future disscuss:

1. for the the filtering part, I experienced some parameter iteration to remove the unnecessary part, but still there are some parts need to be improved.

2. for the training svm part, I have spent some time training different iteration like 10 ,100 , 500, 1000 , it turns out 500 is a relatively reasonable number to get the good result in time to pass the test, but the 1000 is better, which takes way too long, we might need to train in the gpu ssetup

3. I haven't finish the challenging part , but I will keep trying.
